# Smart-Thinking v10.1.0 (Release Candidate)

This release focuses on fully severing dependencies on external AI services, tightening internal heuristics, and shipping the documentation and tooling required for a reproducible deterministic workflow.

## Highlights
- **Offline-first reasoning** – Similarity search, heuristic scoring, verification, and persistence now run locally via the `ReasoningOrchestrator`, `SimilarityEngine`, and updated verification pipeline.
- **Structured reasoning trace** – Each MCP response provides a timeline (`reasoningTimeline`) and detailed `reasoningTrace` entries, enabling replay, auditing, and visualization.
- **CLI walkthrough** – `npm run demo:session` compiles the project and walks through a three-step reasoning scenario, printing heuristic scores, verification outcomes, and graph snapshots for a fresh session.
- **Documentation refresh** – `README.md` includes the new "Reasoning Flow" section and development commands; `GUIDE_INSTALLATION.md` documents platform-specific setup, validation, and release preparation guidance.

## Improvements
- NPM scripts enforce clean builds before `start`, tighten linting (`--max-warnings=0`), and ensure single-threaded Jest execution for deterministic results.
- Persistence utilities capture session metadata on thoughts and verifications, improving hand-off between CLI demos and MCP sessions.
- Service wiring hardens the singleton container pattern and ensures the verification memory always shares the active similarity engine instance.

## Breaking Changes
- External LLM integrations remain disabled (`FeatureFlags.externalLlmEnabled=false`). Any configuration relying on Cohere/OpenRouter must migrate to the internal heuristic pipeline.
- `MemoryManager.addMemory` now writes deterministic metadata suitable for audit trails; callers should treat the return value as informational only.

## Quality Gates
Run these commands before tagging or publishing:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run test:coverage
npm run build
```

## Deployment Notes
- Review `docs/deployment-checklist.md` and confirm every item is complete.
- After publishing, update marketplace entries (MCP Market, Smithery) with the new reasoning flow description and demo command.
- Persisted data from earlier (pre-Phase-6) versions can be imported; redundant LLM fields are ignored during deserialization.

## Credits
Thanks to everyone who helped harden the heuristics, persistence, and documentation throughout Phases 1–6 of the transformation plan.
